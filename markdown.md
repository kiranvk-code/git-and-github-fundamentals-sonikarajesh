# WHAT I HAVE LEARNED FROM THIS COURSE ?

**Git** is a distributed Version Control System (VCS),that helps us to manage multiple versions ofa project or file making it possible to
rewind back to an older version if required. This course helped me to get a better grip over the Git Workflow. 

- The place where all the files of your project are held is called the **REPOSITORY**
- To make a local copy of the remote project, we **CLONE** the repository. 
- When we add/make changes to the local copy of the project, we can update these changes to the remote repository using **COMMIT/PUSH**.
- If we do not want to merge certain changes to the final project, we can create a **BRANCH** other than the main branch to experiment. 
- When we want to contribute to someone else's project, we can **FORK** their repository and work with it. 
- When you make changes to a branch, you can open a **PULL REQUEST** to discuss the changes you made with other developers and merge 
  the branch to the main branch when it is accepted by all.
- **Issues** are used to track the changes and progress of your work on the project. It is used for reporting bugs and requesting features.
